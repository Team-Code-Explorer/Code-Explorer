                <p class="text-justify">
                    Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) represents a significant leap in the evolution of artificial
                    intelligence, aiming to create machines with cognitive abilities comparable to human intelligence.
                    As technology continues to advance, the quest for AGI has become a focal point, transcending narrow
                    AI applications to develop systems capable of generalized learning and problem-solving.
                </p>
                <p class="text-justify">
                    The background of AGI can be traced back to the early days of artificial intelligence research,
                    where pioneers envisioned machines that could understand, learn, and apply knowledge across diverse
                    domains. Unlike specialized AI systems, AGI seeks to replicate the broad spectrum of human cognitive
                    functions, including reasoning, problem-solving, perception, and language understanding.
                </p>
                <p class="text-justify">
                    The context of AGI is shaped by the growing need for machines that can adapt to unforeseen
                    challenges and complexities, mirroring the adaptability and versatility of the human mind. This
                    pursuit goes beyond specific applications and tasks, aiming to create intelligent entities capable
                    of understanding the world in a manner akin to human intelligence.
                </p>
                <p class="text-justify">
                    The journey towards AGI involves navigating through interdisciplinary domains such as computer
                    science, neuroscience, cognitive science, and philosophy. Researchers and scientists are exploring
