                        provides a user-friendly interface for verifying Armstrong numbers—a mathematical concept where
                        the sum of the nth power of each digit in a number equals the number itself. The integration of
                        HTML ensures a visually appealing and accessible platform, while CSS enhances the overall design
                        and user experience. The functionality, powered by JavaScript, allows users to input a number
                        and receive instant feedback on whether it qualifies as an Armstrong number. This project not
                        only demonstrates Subham's technical proficiency but also serves as a practical and educational
                        tool for those interested in exploring number theory concepts through an interactive web-based
                        application. Try <a rel="nofollow" class="external text"
